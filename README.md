# Regression Project on Seoul Bike Rental Count

## Project Overview
This project involves predicting the bike rental count in Seoul based on various features. The dataset contains information about weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and other factors that might influence bike rental demand. The goal of the project is to build a regression model that accurately predicts the number of bike rentals.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about bike rental counts and various features. It includes columns such as date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and more. The target variable is the bike rental count.

## Project Steps
1. Data Loading: Load the dataset and examine its structure.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, convert categorical variables, and perform feature engineering.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the relationships between variables and visualize the data to gain insights.
4. Feature Selection: Identify important features for regression modeling.
5. Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. Model Selection: Choose and implement regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost).
7. Model Training: Train the selected models on the training data.
8. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (RMSE, R-squared).
9. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model's hyperparameters to improve performance.
10. Model Interpretation: Interpret the model results and understand feature importance.
11. Conclusion: Summarize findings, insights, and the performance of the regression model.
